# rcaiman

Tools for preprocessing and processing canopy photographs with support for raw
data reading. Provides methods to address variability in sky brightness and to
mitigate errors from image acquisition in non-diffuse light. Works with all
types of fisheye lenses, and some methods also apply to conventional lenses.

It offers a simple method to calibrate fisheye lense, more details [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168192324001357?via%3Dihub).

It integrates well with other software, such as
[CIMES](http://jmnw.free.fr/), and
[Hemisfer](https://www.schleppi.ch/patrick/hemisfer/).
