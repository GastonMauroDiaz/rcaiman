Description: Tools for preprocessing and processing canopy photographs with 
      support for raw data reading. Provides methods to address variability in 
      sky brightness and to mitigate errors from image acquisition in 
      non-diffuse light. Works with all types of fisheye lenses, and some 
      methods also apply to conventional lenses.
