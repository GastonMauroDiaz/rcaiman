\title{Enhance canopy image}
\usage{
enhance_caim(caim, m, w_red = 0.5, sky_blue = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{caim}{\linkS4class{RasterBrick}. The return of a call to
\code{\link{read_caim}}.}

\item{m}{\linkS4class{RasterLayer}. A mask. Usually, the result of a call to
\code{\link{mask_hs}}.}

\item{w_red}{Numeric vector of length one. Weight of the red channel. A
single layer image is calculated as a weighted average of the blue and red
channels. This layer is used as lightness information. The weight of the
blue is the complement of \code{w_red}.}

\item{sky_blue}{\linkS4class{color}. Is the \code{target_color} argument to
be passed to \code{\link{membership_to_color}}. By default is pure Blue.}
}
\description{
This function is presented in \insertCite{Diaz2015;textual}{rcaiman}. It uses
the color perceptual attributes to enhance the contrast between the sky and
plants through fuzzy classification. Color has three different perceptual
attributes: hue, lightness, and chroma. The algorithm was developed
following this premise: the color of the sky is different from the color of
plants. It performs the next classification rules, here expressed in natural
language: clear sky is blue and clouds decrease its chroma; if clouds are
highly dense, then the sky is achromatic, and, in such cases, it can be light
or dark; everything that does not match this description is not sky. These
linguistic rules were translated to math language by means of fuzzy logic.
}
\details{
This is a pixel-wise methodology that evaluates the possibility for
  a pixel to be member of the class Gap. High score could mean either high
  membership to \code{sky_blue} or, in the case of achromatic pixels, a high
  membership to \code{thr}. The algorithm internally uses
  \code{\link{membership_to_color}} and
  \code{\link{local_fuzzy_thresholding}}. The argument \code{sky_blue} is the
  \code{target_color} of the former function, which output is the argument
  \code{mem} of the latter function.
