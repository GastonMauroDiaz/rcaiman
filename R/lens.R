#' Database of lens projection functions and field of views.
#'
#' In upward-looking leveled hemispherical photography, the zenith is the center
#' of a circle whose perimeter is the horizon. This is true only if the lens
#' field of view is 180ยบ. The relative radius is the radius of concentric
#' circles expressed as a fraction of the radius that belongs to the circle that
#' has the horizon as perimeter. The equidistant model, also called polar, is
#' the most widely used as a standard reference. Real lenses can approximate the
#' projection models, but they always have some kind of distortion. In the
#' equidistant model, the relation between zenith angle and relative radius is
#' modeled with a straight line. Following
#' \href{https://www.schleppi.ch/patrick/hemisfer/}{Hemisfer software}, this
#' package uses a polynomial curve to model lens distortion. A third-order
#' polynomial is sufficient in most cases

#' @param max_fov Logical vector of length one. Use \code{TRUE} to return the

#' @return If \code{max_fov} is set to \code{TRUE}, it returns a numeric vector
#'   of length one, which is the lens maximum field of view in degrees.
#'   Otherwise, it returns a numeric vector with the coefficients of the lens
