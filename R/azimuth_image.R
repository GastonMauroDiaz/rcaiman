#' Azimuth image
#'
#' Build a single layer image with azimuth angles as pixel values.
#'
#' @param z \linkS4class{RasterLayer} built with
#'   \code{\link{zenith_image}}.
#'
#'
#' @return An object of class \linkS4class{RasterLayer} of azimuth angles
#'   in degrees. North (0ยบ) is pointing up as in maps, but East (90ยบ) and West
#'   (270ยบ) are flipped respect to maps. To understand why is that, take two
#'   flash-card size pieces of paper. Put one on a table in front of you and
#'   draw on it a compass rose. Take the other and hold it with your arms
#'   extended over your head, and, following the directions of the compass rose
#'   in front of you, draw another compass rose in the paper side that face
#'   down. Then, put it down and compare both compass roses.
