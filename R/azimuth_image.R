#' Azimuth image
#'
#' Build a single-layer image with azimuth angles as pixel values, assuming
#' upwards-looking hemispherical photography with the optical axis vertically
#' aligned.
#'
#' @inheritParams ootb_mblt
#' @param orientation Azimuth angle (degrees) at which the top of the image was
#'   pointing at the moment of taking the picture. The usual field protocol is
#'   recording the angle at which the top of the camera points.
#'
#' @return An object of class [SpatRaster-class] with azimuth angles in degrees.
#'   If the `orientation` argument is zero, North (0ยบ) is pointing up as in
#'   maps, but East (90ยบ) and West (270ยบ) are flipped regarding to maps. To
#'   understand why is that, do the following: take two flash-card size pieces
#'   of paper; put one on a table in front of you and draw on it a compass rose;
#'   take the other and hold it with your arms extended over your head and,
#'   following the directions of the compass rose in front of you, draw another
#'   one in the paper side that face down--It will be an awkward position, like
#'   if you were taking an upward-looking photo with a mobile device while
#'   looking at the screen--; finally, put it down and compare both compass
#'   roses.
