#' Build azimuth image
#'
#' Creates a single-layer raster in which pixel values represent azimuth
#' angles, assuming an upwards-looking hemispherical photograph with the
#' optical axis vertically aligned.
#'
#' @inheritParams skygrid_segmentation
#'
#' @param orientation numeric vector of length one. Azimuth angle (in degrees)
#'   corresponding to the direction at which the top of the image was pointing
#'   when the picture was taken. This design follows the common field protocol
#'   of recording the angle at which the top of the camera points.
#'
#' @return [terra::SpatRaster-class] with the same dimensions as the input
#'   zenith image. Each pixel contains the azimuth angle in degrees, with zero
#'   representing North and angles increasing counter-clockwise. The
#'   object carries attributes `orientation` and `lens_coef`.
#'
#' @note
#' If `orientation = 0`, North (0 deg) is located at the top of the image, as in
#' conventional maps, but East (90 deg) and West (270 deg) appear flipped
#' relative to maps. To understand this, take two flash-card-sized pieces of
#' paper. Place one on a table in front of you and draw a compass rose on it.
#' Hold the other above your head, with the side facing down toward you, and
#' draw another compass rose following the directions from the one on the table.
#' This mimics the situation of taking an upwards-looking photo with a
#' smartphone while viewing the screen, and it will result in a mirrored
#' arrangement. Compare both drawings to see the inversion.
