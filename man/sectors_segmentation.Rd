\title{Do sectors segmentation}
\usage{
sectors_segmentation(a, angle_width, return_angle = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{a}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster} built with \code{\link[=azimuth_image]{azimuth_image()}}.}

\item{angle_width}{Numeric vector of length one. It should be \verb{30, 15, 10, 7.5, 6, 5, 3.75, 3, 2.5, 1.875, 1} or \code{0.5} degrees. This
constrain is rooted in the requirement of a value able to divide both the
\code{0} to \code{360} and \code{0} to \code{90} ranges into a whole number
of segments.}

\item{return_angle}{Logical vector of length one. If it is \code{FALSE}, all
the pixels that belong to a segment are labeled with an ID number.
Otherwise, the angle mean of the segment is assigned to the pixels.}
}
\value{
An object of the class \linkS4class{SpatRaster} with segments
shaped like pizza slices.
}
\description{
Segment a hemispherical view by slicing the azimuth angle from zero
to 360ยบ in equals intervals.
}
\examples{
z <- zenith_image(600, lens())
a <- azimuth_image(z)
sectors <- sectors_segmentation(a, 15)
plot(sectors == 1)
