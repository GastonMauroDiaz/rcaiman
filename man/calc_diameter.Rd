\title{Calculate diameter}
\usage{
calc_diameter(lens_coef, radius_px, angle)
}
\arguments{
\item{lens_coef}{Numeric vector. Polynomial coefficients of the lens
projection function.}

\item{radius_px}{Numeric vector. Distance in pixels from the zenith.}

\item{angle}{Numeric vector. Zenith angle in degrees.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length one. Diameter adjusted to a whole number
  (see \code{\link{zenith_image}} for details about that constrain).
}
\description{
Calculate the diameter in pixels of a 180º fisheye image.
}
\details{
This function helps handle devices with a field of view different than 180
degrees. Given a lens projection function and data points consisting of radii
(pixels) and their correspondent zenith angle (\eqn{\theta}), it returns the
radius of the horizon (i.e., the radius for \eqn{\theta} equal to 90
degrees).

When working with non-circular hemispherical photography, this function will
help to find the diameter that a circular image would have if the equipment
would record the whole hemisphere.

The required data (radius-angle data) can be obtained following the
instructions given in the
\href{https://www.schleppi.ch/patrick/hemisfer/help/en/lens.htm}{user manual
of Hemisfer software}. The following is a slightly simpler alternative:

\itemize{

\item Find a vertical wall and a leveled floor, both well-constructed. For
instance, a parking lot.

\item Draw a triangle of \eqn{5 \times 4 \times 3} meters on the floor, with
the 4-meter side over the wall.

\item Locate the camera over the vertex that is 3 meters away from the wall.
Place it at a given height above the floor, 1.3 meters for instance.

\item Make a mark on the wall at chosen height over the wall-vertex nearest
to the camera-vertex. Make four more marks with one meter of spacing and
following a horizontal line. This will create marks for 0º, 18º, 34º, 45º,
and 54º \eqn{\theta}.

\item Before taking the photograph, do not forget to align the zenith
coordinates with the 0º \eqn{\theta} mark and check if the optical axis is
leveled.

The

selection tool} of \href{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html}{ImageJ} can
be used to measure the distance in pixels between points on the image. Draw a
line, and use the dropdown menu Analyze>Measure to obtain its length.
