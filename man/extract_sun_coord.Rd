\usage{
extract_sun_coord(r, z, a, bin, g, max_angular_dist = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster}. A normalized greyscale image. Typically, the
blue channel extracted from a canopy photograph. Please see \code{\link[=read_caim]{read_caim()}}
and \code{\link[=normalize]{normalize()}}.}

\item{z}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster} built with \code{\link[=zenith_image]{zenith_image()}}.}

\item{a}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster} built with \code{\link[=azimuth_image]{azimuth_image()}}.}

\item{bin}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster}. This should be a preliminary binarization of
\code{r} useful for masking pixels that are very likely pure sky pixels.}

\item{g}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster} built with \code{\link[=sky_grid_segmentation]{sky_grid_segmentation()}} or
\code{\link[=chessboard]{chessboard()}}.}

\item{max_angular_dist}{Numeric vector of length one. Angle in degrees to
control the potential maximum size of the solar corona.}
}
\value{
Object of class \emph{list} with two numeric vectors of length two
named \emph{row_col} and \emph{zenith_azimuth}. The former is the raster
coordinates of the solar disk (row and column), and the other is the
angular coordinates (zenith and azimuth angles in degrees).

\description{
Extract the sun coordinates for CIE sky model fitting.

\details{
This function uses an object-based image analyze framework. The segmentation
is given by \code{g} and \code{bin}. For every cell of \code{g}, the pixels
from \code{r} that are equal to one on \code{bin} are selected and its
maximum value is calculated. Then, the 95th percentile of these maximum
values is computed and used to filter out cells below that threshold; i.e,
only the cells with at least one extremely bright sky pixel is selected.

The selected cells are grouped based on adjacency, and new bigger segments
are created from these groups. The degree of membership to the class
\emph{Sun} is calculated for every new segment by computing the number of
cells that constitute the segment and its mean digital number (values taken
from \code{r}). In other words, the  largest and brightest segments are the
ones that score higher. The one with the highest score is selected as the
\emph{sun seed}.

The angular distance from the sun seed to every other segments are computed,
and only the segments not farther than \code{max_angular_dist} are classified
as part of the sun corona. A multi-part segment is created by merging the
sun-corona segments and, finally, the center of its bounding box is
considered as the sun location.
