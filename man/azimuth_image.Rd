\title{Azimuth image}
\usage{
azimuth_image(z, orientation = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster} built with \code{\link{zenith_image}}.}

\item{orientation}{The azimuthal angle at which the top of the image is
facing, in degrees. Generally, it corresponds to the angle at which the top
of the camera was facing at the moment of acquisition.}
}
\value{
An object of class \linkS4class{SpatRaster} with azimuth angles in
  degrees. If the \code{orientation} argument is zero, North (0ยบ) is pointing
  up as in maps, but East (90ยบ) and West (270ยบ) are flipped respecting to
  maps. To understand why is that, do the following: take two flash-card size
  pieces of paper; put one on a table in front of you and draw on it a
  compass rose; take the other and hold it with your arms extended over your
  head and, following the directions of the compass rose in front of you,
  draw another one in the paper side that face down--It will be an awkward
  position, like if you were taking an upward-looking photo with a mobile
  device while looking at the screen--; finally, put it down and compare both
  compass roses.
}
\description{
Build a single layer image with azimuth angles as pixel values.
