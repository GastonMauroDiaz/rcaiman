\title{Build azimuth image}
\usage{
azimuth_image(z, orientation = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster} built with \code{\link[=zenith_image]{zenith_image()}}.}

\item{orientation}{Azimuth angle (degrees) at which the top of the image was
pointing at the moment of taking the picture. This design decision was made
because the usual field protocol is recording the angle at which the top of
the camera points.}
}
\value{
An object of class \linkS4class{SpatRaster} with azimuth angles in degrees.
If the \code{orientation} argument is zero, North (0ยบ) is pointing up as in
maps, but East (90ยบ) and West (270ยบ) are flipped regarding to maps. To
understand why, take two flash-card size pieces of paper; put one on a
table in front of you and draw on it a compass rose; take the other and
hold it with your arms extended over your head and, following the
directions of the compass rose in front of you, draw another one in the
paper side that is facing down---it will be an awkward position, like if
you were taking an upward-looking photo with a mobile device while looking
at the screen---; finally, put it down and compare both compass roses.
}
\description{
Build a single-layer image with azimuth angles as pixel values, assuming
upwards-looking hemispherical photography with the optical axis vertically
aligned.
