\title{Out-of-the-box sky reconstruction}
\usage{
ootb_sky_reconstruction(r, z, a, bin, filling_source = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster}. A normalized greyscale image. Typically,
the blue channel extracted from a canopy photograph. Please see
\code{\link{read_caim}} and \code{\link{normalize}}.}

\item{z}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster} built with \code{\link{zenith_image}}.}

\item{a}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster} built with \code{\link{azimuth_image}}.}

\item{bin}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster}. This should be a preliminary
binarization of \code{r} useful for masking pixels that are very likely to
be pure sky pixels.}

\item{filling_source}{\linkS4class{SpatRaster}. An actual or reconstructed
above-canopy image to complement the sky pixels detected through the gaps
of \code{r}. If an incomplete above-canopy image is available, non-sky
pixels should be turned \code{NA} or they will be considered as sky pixels
erroneously. A photograph taken immediately after or before taking \code{r}
under the open sky with the same equipment and configuration is a very good
option but not recommended under fleeting clouds. The orientation relative
to the North must be the same as for \code{r}. If it is set to \code{NULL}
(default), only sky pixels from \code{r} will be used as input.}

Build an above canopy image from a single below canopy image.

\details{
This function is a hard-coded version of a pipeline that uses these main
functions \code{\link{fit_cie_sky_model}} and
\code{\link{interpolate_sky_points}}. The code can be easily inspected by
calling \code{ootb_sky_reconstruction}--no parenthesis. Advanced users could
use that code as a template.

This pipeline is based on \insertCite{Lang2010;textual}{rcaiman}. The main
differences between the original method by
\insertCite{Lang2010;textual}{rcaiman} and the one implemented here are:

\itemize{

\item it is fully automatic,

\item the residuals of the CIE sky model (\eqn{residuals=model-data}) are
interpolated instead of the sky digital numbers (the data), and

\item the final sky reconstruction is obtained by subtracting the
interpolated residuals to the CIE sky model instead of by calculating a
weighted average parameterized by the user.

}

The recommended input for this function is data pre-processed with the HSP
software package \insertCite{Lang2013}{rcaiman}. Please, refer to
\code{\link{write_sky_points}} for additional details about HSP and refer to
\code{\link{fit_cie_sky_model}} and \code{\link{interpolate_sky_points}} to
know why the HSP pre-processing is convenient.


Providing a \code{filling source} triggers an alternative pipeline in which
the sky is fully reconstructed with \code{\link{interpolate_sky_points}}
after a dense sampling (\eqn{1 \times 1} degree cells), which is supported by
the fact that sky digital numbers will be available for almost every pixel,
either from \code{r} gaps or from the filling source--an exception is a
filling source with plenty of \code{NA} values, which should not be provided.
