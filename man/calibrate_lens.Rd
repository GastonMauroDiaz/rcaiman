\usage{
calibrate_lens(path_to_csv, degree = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_to_csv}{Character vector of length one. Path to a CSV file created
with the
\href{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html#sec:Multi-point-Tool}{point
 selection tool of ‘ImageJ’ software}.}

\item{degree}{Numeric vector of length one. Polynomial model degree.}
}
\value{
An object of class \emph{list} with named elements. \emph{lens_coef}
  stands for lens coefficients, \emph{max_theta} for maximum zenith angle in
  degrees, and \emph{max_theta_px} for distance in pixels between the zenith
  and the maximum zenith angle in pixels units. The latter should be double
  checked, particularly if the zenith push pin is not exactly on the zenith
  pixel. To that end, do the following on ImageJ: use the
  \href{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html#toc-Subsection-19.1}{rectangular
   selection tool} to create a small rectangle, open the Specify window by
  going to the dropdown menu Edit>Selection>Specify..., insert the zenith
  coordinates (obtained with \code{\link{calc_zenith_raster_coord}}) into the
  respective X and Y fields in order to align the upper-left corner of the
  rectangle with the zenith, mark it with the
  \href{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html#toc-Subsection-19.14}{brush},
   use the
  \href{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html#toc-Subsection-19.2}{straight
  selection tool} to find the length within the zenith and the maximum zenith
  angle showed in the image.

\description{
Calibrate a fisheye lens. This type of lens has wide field of view and a
consistent azimuthal distortion. The latter property allows fitting a precise
mathematical relation between the distance to the zenith on the image space
and the zenith angle on the hemispherical space.

\details{
These are the instructions to produce the CSV file required by this function.
The following materials are required:

\itemize{

\item this package and \href{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html}{ImageJ}

\item camera and lens

\item tripod

\item standard yoga mat

\item table about two times wider than the yoga mat width

\item twenty two push pins of different colors

\item scissors

\item one print of this \href{https://osf.io/tudzc/download}{sheet} (A1 size,
almost like a poster).

}

Cut the sheet by the dashed line. Place the yoga mat extended on top of the
table. Place the sheet on top of the yoga mat. Align the dashed line with the
yoga mat border closest to you. Place push pins on each cross. If you are
gentle, the yoga mat will allows you to do that without damaging the table.
Of course, other materials could be used to obtain the same result, such as
cardboard, foam, nails, etc.

Place the camera on the tripod. Align its optical axis with the table while
looking for getting an image showing the overlapping of the three pairs of
push pins as instructed in the print. In order to take care of the line of
pins at 90º relative to the optical axis, it may be better to use the naked
eye to align the front of the lens with the pins.

Transfer the photograph to the computer, open it with ImageJ, and use the
\href{https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-19.html#sec:Multi-point-Tool}{point
selection tool} to digitize the push pins, starting from the zenith push pin
and not skipping any showed push pin. Then, use the dropdown menu
Analyze>Measure to open the window Results. To obtain the CSV, use File>Save
As...

This method was inspired by the calibration board from
\insertCite{Clark1988;textual}{rcaiman}.

\strong{TIP:} use \code{\link{test_lens_coef}} to test if coefficients are
OK. If not, try moving the last points a little bit. Putting the last one a
few pixels farther from the zenith is usually enough.
