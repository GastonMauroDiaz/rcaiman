\usage{
ootb_mblt(r, z, a)
}
\arguments{
\item{r}{\linkS4class{RasterLayer}. A normalized greyscale image. Typically,
the blue channel extracted from an hemispherical photographs. Please see
\code{\link{read_caim}} and \code{\link{normalize}}.}

\item{z}{\linkS4class{RasterLayer}. The result of a call to
\code{\link{zenith_image}}.}

\item{a}{\linkS4class{RasterLayer}. The result of a call to
\code{\link{azimuth_image}}.}
}
\value{
Object of class list with the binarized image (named "bin") and the
  reconstructed skies named as follow: "sky_cs" is the cone shaped model,
  "sky_s" is the trend surface, and "sky" is the combination of both and
  actually used to obtain "bin".

\description{
Out-of-the-box version of the model-based local thresholding (MBLT)
algorithm.
}
\details{
This function is a hard-coded version of a MBLT pipeline that starts with a
working binarized image and ended with a refined binarized image. The
pipeline combines \code{\link{find_sky_dns}},
\code{\link{fit_cone_shaped_model}}, \code{\link{fit_trend_surface}}, and
\code{\link{thr_image}}. The code can be easily inspected by calling
\code{ootb_mblt} --no parenthesis. Advanced users could use that code as a
template.

The MBLT algorithm was first presented in
\insertCite{Diaz2018;textual}{rcaiman}. This version differs from that in the
following main aspects:

\itemize{

\item $intercept$ is set to 0, $slope$ to 1, and $w$ to 0.5

\item This version implements a regional threholding approach as first step
instead of a global one. Please refer to \code{\link{find_sky_dns}}. The
minimum number of samples (sky dns) required is equals to the 30 % of the
population, considering that it is made of 5 $/times$ 5 sky grid cells.

\item It does not use asynchronous acquisition under the open sky. So, the
cone shaped model (\code{\link{fit_cone_shaped_model}}) run without a filling
source, but the result of it is used as filling source for trend surface
fitting (\code{\link{fit_trend_surface}}).

\item The sDN obtained by trend surface fitting is merged with the sDN
obtained with \code{\link{fit_cone_shaped_model}}. To merge them, a weighted
average is calculated, being weights calculated as $/theta^2 / 90^2$ (Near
the zenith, values obtained by means of trend surface fitting prevail over
the ones obtained with the cone shaped model, and the opposite occur near the
horizon).
